This page describes a typical Smart City Application, which can be a starting point for cities to benefit from a digital era, in which both citizens and infrastructure are digitally connected. 

The demo illustrates how the integration of several vertical solutions in a central platform, benefits a City as well as it Citizens:
* creating new applications requiring the (combination of) vertical solutions, using rules based algorithms as well creating dedicated front-end applications
* active monitoring of all sensors, and actors via healthchecks, for maintenance purposes
* exposing the data as assets and attributes, in a standardised manner via APIs, including the right acces rights, either 'restricted' to certain users and roles, or 'public'.

The basic set-up is part of the demo environment and the main branch. You can take it as a starting point for developing your own application.

We have described the demo here, with its several vertical solutions.
