Welcome to the OpenRemote wiki.

## Quickstart

Checkout the [main OpenRemote project](https://github.com/openremote/openremote) and run a demo setup with [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/):

```
docker-compose -p openremote -f profile/demo.yml up
```

Access the manager UI and API on https://localhost/ with username admin and password secret (accept the 'insecure' self-signed SSL certificate). Configuration options of the images are documented in the compose profile `demo.yml`.
