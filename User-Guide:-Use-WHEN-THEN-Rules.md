WHEN-THEN Rules are used in combination with the or-rules UI component. They are meant to be used to allow application users to define WHEN THIS THAN THAT statements. For example "turn on a light when it's clouded" or "send push notification to anybody who reaches the stadium".

The WHEN-THEN rules can be edited via a Rules UI, using the or-rules component. For examples of the Rules UI, have a look at the [Demo Smart City](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Demo-Smart-City).
