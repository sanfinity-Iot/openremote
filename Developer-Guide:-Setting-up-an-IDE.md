This guide helps you set up an environment with an IDE when you are done [[Preparing the environment|Developer Guide: Preparing the environment]], so you can work comfortably on the Manager backend services.

This is not necessary if you prefer [[Working on the UI|Developer Guide: Working on the UI]] only, any file manager and text editor will suffice.

## Run required services

Make sure testing services are running as described in [[Creating a custom project|Developer Guide: Creating a custom project]]:

### Without SSL and proxy
```
docker-compose -p openremote -f profile/dev-testing.yml up --build -d
```

### With SSL and proxy
```
docker-compose -p openremote -f profile/dev-proxy.yml up --build -d
```

**NOTE: You will need to add the following environment variables within your IDE for the manager to work behind the proxy with SSL:**

```
WEBSERVER_LISTEN_HOST=0.0.0.0
IDENTITY_NETWORK_WEBSERVER_PORT=443
IDENTITY_NETWORK_SECURE=true
```

## Importing a project in an IDE

### IntelliJ IDEA

You can download the [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for free.

- Choose the 'Open' option in the startup screen and open the root directory of the OpenRemote codebase.
- Note that IntelliJ might time out if a background Gradle process (for example, running the GWT compiler server) blocks the Gradle import. Stop and start the background process to unblock.
- Run `./gradlew clean installDist` in a terminal in IntelliJ to be sure everything compiles.

##### Recommended Plugins
- [Grep Console](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7125-grep-console)
- [Markdown Navigator](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator)

##### Grep Console Styling
The log messages of the running application can be colour-highlighted with the [GrepConsole plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7125-grep-console) and our [configuration](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/tree/master/tools/intellij).

- Locate XML style config for Grep Console in openremote/tools/intellij
- Choice the default or dark styling config
- Copy the xml to your IntelliJ IDEA Config folder 

```
cp ~/<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/openremote/tools/intellij/Theme-<Default|Darcula>-GrepConsole.xml \
~/.IntelliJIdea<VERSION>/config/options/GrepConsole.xml
```

### Eclipse

- Run `./gradlew eclipse`
- In Eclipse go to `File` > `Import` and import the project as `Existing Projects into Workspace`

## Setting the working directory

All Docker and Gradle commands **must be executed in the project root directory**. If you are working on the main OpenRemote repository, this means the root of the repository. If you are [[Creating a custom project|Developer Guide: Creating a custom project]], this means the root of your project's repository.

The working directory in your IDE however must always be set to the **OpenRemote project directory**. All configuration settings in source code default to this location. This means if you are [[Creating a custom project|Developer Guide: Creating a custom project]], your IDE will work in the `openremote` submodule directory.

We recommend you set this as the default directory in your IDE for all *Run Configurations*. To improve creation and execution of ad-hoc tests in the IDE you should set the default working directory for JUnit Run Configurations:

[[resources/Intellij - Run configuration default settings.png]]

### Note: In newer versions of IntelliJ you need to change some run options. Go to Preferences -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle. Choose for the options 'Build and run using' and 'Run tests using' the option 'IntelliJ' and click on 'Apply'.

## Running and debugging the Manager

The main entry point of the backend services is a Java class for the OpenRemote Manager, this process provides the frontend API and is the core of OpenRemote.

Make sure required testing services are running as described above.

Set up a *Run Configuration*:

- Module/Classpath: `manager` or `myproject:myextension1` for custom projects
- Working directory: *Must be set to OpenRemote main project directory!*
- Main class: `org.openremote.manager.Main`
- Any environment variables that customise deployment (usually custom projects have some)

You can now open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) or [https://localhost/](https://localhost/) (depending on docker compose profile chosen) in your browser. The default login is username `admin` with password `secret`.

*NOTE: The web server binds to only localhost interface (i.e. `127.0.0.1`). You can override this with `WEBSERVER_LISTEN_HOST=0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces and make it accessible on your LAN.*

## VisualVM
To inspect the threads, analyzing CPU and memory allocation you should running a VisualVM.

- Download and install VisualVM from the [visualvm](https://visualvm.github.io/) website.
- Install the [VisualVM Launcher](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7115-visualvm-launcher) for IntelliJ IDEA

## Executing tests

Any JUnit test can be directly executed, you can create a Run Configuration for the `test` module and run all tests in the IDE. Ensure that the `profile/dev-testing.yml` background service stack is running, as described above.
