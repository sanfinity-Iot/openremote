JSON Rules are intended to be used in combination with the or-rules UI component. They are meant to be used to allow application users to define IF THIS THAN THAT statements. For example "turn on a light when presence is detected" or "send an e-mail if the alarm is set off".

The JSON rules can be seen in the (Technical) Manager but should be edited via a Rules UI, using the or-rules component. For examples of the Rules UI, have a look at the [Demo Smart Building](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Demo-Smart-Building) and [Demo Smart City](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Demo-Smart-City).

# How JSON rules work?

- JSON rules structure
- or-rules component
- configuration of assets and attributes to be available within the Rules UI
