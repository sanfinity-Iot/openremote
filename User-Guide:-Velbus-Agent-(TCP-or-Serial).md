Connect to a [Velbus](https://www.velbus.eu/) network using either of the following implementations:

* Direct RS232/Serial using `VMBRSUSB` or `VMB1USB` - [Velbus Serial Agent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/agent/src/main/java/org/openremote/agent/protocol/velbus/VelbusSerialAgent.java)
* TCP/IP using [VelServ](https://github.com/jeroends/velserv) or similar - [Velbus TCP Agent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/agent/src/main/java/org/openremote/agent/protocol/velbus/VelbusTcpAgent.java)


## Agent configuration
The following describes the Velbus agent supported configuration attributes:

### TCP
| Attribute | Description | Value type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `host` | TCP server hostname or IP address | [Hostname or IP address](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/value/ValueType.java#L153) | Y |
| `port` | TCP server port | [Port number](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/value/ValueType.java#L148) | Y |

### Serial
| Attribute | Description | Value type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `serialPort` | Serial port | Text | Y |


### TCP & Serial
| Attribute | Description | Value type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `timeInjectionInterval` | Time injection interval (s) - as Velbus doesn't have RTC or support daylight saving time so this should be set to about 1hr | [Positive Integer](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/value/ValueType.java#L83) | Y |

## Agent link
For attributes linked to a Velbus agent, the following describes the supported agent link fields which are in addition to the standard [Agent Link](./User-Guide:-Agent-Overview#agent-links) fields:

| Field | Description | Value type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `deviceAddress` | The Velbus module address to link to | Integer (1-254) | Y |
| `deviceValueLink` | The Velbus module value to link to | Text (see below) | Y |

***

### Hardware compatibility table

'x' indicates a colour option that does not affect the capability of the module.

Modules are queried for their module type during initialisation, non-compatible modules will **not work in any way**.

> The three commands above are needed separately in order to fully support the Velbus protocol. So in order for your Velbus system to perform as expected you shouldn't just use a Press command within a user interface if you are trying to mimic a button press. You should create a macro for each button you want to mimic, for standard presses, or long presses. The macro should contain the button press command, a delay (25ms is normal for a button press) and a release command. There is a button widget operational change currently being planned (July 2015) which will facilitate a command when pressed and a command when released. This will mean that 'press and hold' dimming will be possible with Long_Press & Release commands, or momentary relay closures with the Press & Release combination.

> The ALARM_TIME command will alter either the LOCAL or MASTER alarm time depending on which of the two modes this alarm is set to (it is not possible to specify the alarm type as there is no way of reading the time for both alarm types, as the time is the same, with only a bit set for master or local)
>

Formula for alarm times in minutes:

Given that 24 hours have 1439 unique minutes, the easiest way to work out the alarm time in minutes is to use a simple spreadsheet that works out;
(Hour x 60 minutes) + minutes past the hour

> It is best practise to use VelbusLink to define Master alarm groups, then only incorporate alarm time changes for a single Master alarm module in an OpenRemote controller.



> Dynamic time setting can be achieved by creating a grid which displays the alarm time in the middle and a selection of incrementing and decrementing ALARM_TIME_RELATIVE commands. I.E. +1 min, -5 min, +60 min, +180 min (3 hours)
