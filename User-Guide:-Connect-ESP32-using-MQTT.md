ESP32 is one of the most popular and well established boards for devices. ESP32 can be easily linked to an OpenRemote instance using our MQTT Broker. If you have larger numbers of devices connecting you might want to use the auto provisioning flow. This allows you to provision your devices in such a way that they automatically connect your devices to OpenRemote, create an asset of the type you have defined, and link the attributes over the right topics. ESP32 is perfectly suitable to make use of it.

Here are some practical tips and code samples to get you going.

# Publishing and subscribing to topics over MQTT

This a basic MQTT example for OpenRemote [www.openremote.io](http://www.openremote.io/)

<details><summary>OpenRemoteESP32.ino</summary>
<p>

```
#include "secret.h"
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <PubSubClient.h>

//Objects
WiFiClientSecure askClient; //If you use non SSL then WiFiClient askClient;
PubSubClient client(askClient);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println(ssid);

  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);

  }

  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
  askClient.setCACert(local_root_ca); //If you use non SSL then comment out
  client.setServer(mqtt_server, mqtt_port);
  client.setCallback(callback);

}

void loop() {
  //Publish Boolean format:
  client.publish("master/xxxxxxxxxx/writeattributevalue/AttributeName/AsssetID", "1");
  //To publish Strings:
  client.publish("master/xxxxxxxxxx/writeattributevalue/AttributeName/AssetID", String("Hello").c_str());
  delay(10000);

}

//MQTT callback
void callback(char* topic, byte * payload, unsigned int length) {

  for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    Serial.println(topic);
    Serial.print(" has send ");
    Serial.print((char)payload[i]);
  }

}

//MQTT reconnect
void reconnect() {
  // Loop until we're reconnected
  while (!client.connected()) {
    Serial.print("********** Attempting MQTT connection...");
    // Attempt to connect
    if (client.connect(ClientID, username, mqttpass, lastwill, 1, 1, lastwillmsg)) {
      Serial.println("-> MQTT client connected");
      client.subscribe(topic);
      Serial.print("Subscribed to: ";
      Serial.println(topic);
    } else {
      Serial.print("failed, rc=");
      Serial.print(client.state());
      Serial.println("-> try again in 5 seconds");
      // Wait 5 seconds before retrying
      delay(5000);
    }
  }
}

```

This Code is for an ESP32 In case you use an ESP8266, change the WiFi Library. #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

For ESP8266 SSL Connection, you need a fingerprint of your Server Certificate Example: "static const char *fingerprint PROGMEM = "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00";" and in the setup: askClient.setFingerprint(fingerprint);

This sketch demonstrates the basic capabilities of the library. It connects to an OpenRemote MQTT server then:

- publishes boolean "1" to your topic
- publishes "Hello" to another topic
- subscribes to your topic printing out any messages

It will reconnect to the server if the connection is lost using a blocking reconnect function.

Edit secret.h for your credentials.

In case you connect to the broker nonsecure, change the object "WifiClientSecure" to "WifiClient" and comment out in setup askClient.setCACert(local_root_ca); Also change the MQTT Port in secret.h

Important: Don't forget to add the PubSubClient to your Library https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
