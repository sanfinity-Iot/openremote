## Manager APIs
The OpenRemote Manager API is composed of the following APIs, each API requires authentication (with the exception of `read`/`write` of public `asset` `attributes` see [Asset security](./User-Guide%3A-Asset-Security)).

To be able to authenticate you'll need to create a service user using the Manager UI (must be logged in as super user to access this functionality), please refer to the Manager UI user guide; access tokens can be obtained from the token endpoint using standard OAuth 2.0 techniques.

* OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint: `/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token`
* Regular user supported grant type(s): `authorizationCode`
* Service user supported grant type(s): `client_credentials`



## HTTP API
This is the traditional request response API with live documentation available via Swagger UI (see `/swagger/` URL of your manager) or you can look at the [demo environment](https://demo.openremote.io/swagger/). The base URL for the API is:
```
/api/{realm}/
```

Authentication is done using standard `Authorization` header in the format `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}` where `accessToken` is a valid access token obtained from the token endpoint.

## WS (Websocket) API
This is a publish subscribe API that is event based, the URL for connecting to this API is:

```
/websocket/events?Auth-Realm={realm}&Authorization={accessToken}
```

Authentication is done using `Authorization` query parameter with a valid access token obtained from the token endpoint. The realm of the authenticating user must also be included as an `Auth-Realm` query parameter.

### Subscriptions
A subscription is created by sending an [EventSubscription](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/shared/EventSubscription.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `SUBSCRIBE:`. When a subscribe message is sent then the server will determine if the requesting user is authorised to make such a subscription and if so then the manager will reply with the same subscription `JSON` object but prefixed with `SUBSCRIBED:`, if the user is not authorised then the subscription `JSON` object will be returned but prefixed with `UNAUTHORIZED:`.

When an event occurs in the manager that matches an existing subscription then a [TriggeredEventSubscription](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/TriggeredEventSubscription.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `TRIGGERED:` will be sent to the client.

### Request response emulation
To emulate the request response nature of the HTTP API it is possible to send an [EventRequestResponseWrapper](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/event/shared/EventRequestResponseWrapper.java) as `JSON` prefixed with `REQUESTRESPONSE:`, the `messageId` is used to allow the client to associate the request message with the response message. This request response emulation is useful for example to read an asset.

For more details on the structure of messages please refer to the `javadoc` of each object type for detailed information.

## MQTT API (MQTT Broker)
Another publish subscribe API, authentication requires a service user client ID and secret and is done using standard `MQTT` username and password mechanism, to connect to the broker:

* Host: Host of the manager (e.g. `demo.openremote.io`)
* Port: 8883 (if running with SSL i.e. the standard stack with reverse SSL proxy) 1883 (if running without SSL proxy)
* Encryption/TLS: true (port 8883) false (port 1883)
* Username: `{realm}:{username}`
* Password: `{secret}`

### Subscriptions
It is possible to subscribe to [AssetEvents](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/asset/AssetEvent.java) (topics starting with `asset/`) and/or [AttributeEvents](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) (topics starting with `attribute/`). The topic structures are as follows:

* `asset/#` - All asset events in the realm
* `asset/{assetId}`- All asset events for the specified asset
* `asset/{assetId}/#`- All asset events for descendants of the specified asset
* `asset/{assetId}/+`- All asset events for direct children of the specified asset

* `attribute/#` - All attribute events in the realm
* `attribute/#/{attributeName}` - All attribute events with specified name in the realm
* `attribute/{assetId}`- All attribute events for the specified asset
* `attribute/{assetId}/{attributeName}`- All attribute events with specified name for the specified asset
* `attribute/{assetId}/#`- All attribute events for descendants of the specified asset
* `attribute/{assetId}/#/{attributeName}`- All attribute events with specified name for descendants of the specified asset
* `attribute/{assetId}/+`- All attribute events for direct children of the specified asset
* `attribute/{assetId}/+/{attributeName}`- All attribute events with specified name for direct children of the specified asset

`attributevalue` topic prefix can be used in place of `attribute` to only return the value of the [AttributeEvent](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/blob/master/model/src/main/java/org/openremote/model/attribute/AttributeEvent.java) rather then the entire event.
