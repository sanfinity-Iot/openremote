This guide assumes you have installed the Docker engine and connected to that engine as described in the other developer guides). Ensure that you have also built the code base before trying to deploy any Docker profiles:

```
./gradlew clean prepareImage
```

## Docker services
The following services are used by the main OpenRemote code base:

* haproxy - Reverse SSL proxy for the web services
* letsencrypt - SSL certificate generation
* manager - Runs the OpenRemote Manager (by default depends on postgresql and keycloak)
* postgresql - PostgreSQL DB
* keycloak - Keycloak identity provider service

## Docker deployment profiles

Docker deployment profiles (Docker Compose files) are used to configure and start required services; the standard profiles are located in the `profile` folder of the main OpenRemote repository. Custom projects should use the same profiles where possible but can define new profiles as required (they should be stored in `profile` folder of the custom project repository).

The default configuration for profiles assumes that all services are on localhost if this is not the case then a configuration override will be required for the affected services.

The standard profiles are:

* manager (manager.yml) - Contains all the services that may be required to run the manager as a service (haproxy, letsencrypt, manager, postgresql, keycloak)

### Overriding profile configuration

The configuration required for different environments may well vary so a configuration override file should be used (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) for more details). Override configurations should be located in the same folder as the profiles using the naming convention:

`<PROFILE>.<ENVIRONMENT>.yml e.g. manager.demo.yml`

Running profiles with an override is simply a matter of specifying the override file using the CLI:

```docker-compose -f manager.yml -f manager.demo.yml up -d```

### Specifying which services to start

When starting a profile (`docker compose up`) all services will be started by default but the services to start can be specified using the CLI:

```
docker-compose -f manager.yml -f manager.demo.yml up -d postgresql keycloak
```

**NOTE: Services linked to the requested services will also be started**

## Building/Pulling services

Services will be built automatically when they do not exist in the Docker engine image cache or when the Dockerfile for the service changes. **Docker does not track changes to the files used in a service so when code changes are made you will need to manually force a build of the service**.

It is possible to force Docker to pull images from the `openremote` Docker Hub repository by using the following command:
```
docker-compose -f <PROFILE> pull <SERVICE> <SERVICE>... e.g. docker-compose -f profile/manager.yml pull (pull all services)
```

## Deploying profiles
Deploying profiles requires id
entifying:

* The profile configuration to deploy
* The override configuration to use (if required)
* The services to start (defaults to all)

When deploying profiles you can provide a project name to prefix the container names (by default Docker Compose will use the configuration profile's folder name); the project name can be specified with the -p argument using the CLI:

```
docker-compose -p <your_project_name> -f <profile> -f <profile_override> up -d <service1> <service2> ...
```

## Useful notes

Working with Docker might leave exited containers, untagged images, and dangling volumes. The following bash function can be used to clean up:

```
function dcleanup(){
    docker rm -v $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
    docker rmi $(docker images --filter dangling=true -q 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
}
```
