The OpenRemote Mobile Apps render the consoles (user interface of an OpenRemote application) using a web view and provide bridging of native device functionality to provide a native app experience. 

## Android Console

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), then open the `console/android` project. 

TODO: There is actually nothing to build right now, you have to create a custom project and a dependency on our Android console project from your own Android app. 

## iOS Console

TODO: Document build
