# Docker services
The following services are used by the main OpenRemote code base:

* proxy - Reverse SSL proxy (HAProxy) for the web services with auto SSL certificate generation (letsencrypt)
* manager - Runs the OpenRemote Manager (by default depends on postgresql and keycloak)
* postgresql - PostgreSQL DB
* keycloak - Keycloak identity provider service

# Docker compose profiles
Docker compose profiles (Docker Compose `.yml` files) are used to configure and start required services; the standard profiles are located in the profile folder of the main [OpenRemote repository](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/tree/master/profile).

The standard profiles are:

## Deploy (deploy.yml)
This is the main profile which all other profiles extend; it can't be used directly.

## Demo (demo.yml)
This is a demo profile which starts all services and provides a quick start for getting a running local deployment.

### Prerequisites
Docker images must have been pulled from Docker Hub or the full stack must be built ready to build the docker images locally:
```
./gradlew clean installDist
```

## Demo Raspberry Pi (demo-rpi.yml)
This is for demo for running the full stack on a Raspberry Pi; it doesn't use the keycloak identity service but instead uses a simple identity service.

## UI Development (dev.yml)
This is for doing development work on the UI (i.e. Front end apps and/or components and/or Keycloak themes).

### Prerequisites
Docker images must have been pulled from Docker Hub or the full stack must be built ready to build the docker images locally:
```
./gradlew clean installDist
```

### Exposed Services
* Manager: https://localhost
* PostgreSQL DB: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openremote

### Volume Maps
* ../keycloak/theme - Maps custom keycloak theme into the Keycloak service; changes to the local theme are instantly available to the keycloak service
* ../deployment - Maps deployment folder into the Manager service; the mapped local path can be overridden using the `DEPLOYMENT_DIRECTORY` environment variable (.e.g. = `DEPLOYMENT_DIRECTORY=../../deployment docker-compose -f openremote/profile/dev.yml`)

## Full Stack Development / Running Tests (dev-testing.yml)
This is for running tests or doing development work on the Manager (in an IDE) as well as the UI (i.e. Front end apps and/or components and/or Keycloak themes); starts the Keycloak and PostgreSQL services, see the [Working on the Manager] (./Developer-Guide%3A-Working-on-the-Manager) guide for running the Manager in an IDE.

### Exposed Services
* Keycloak: http://localhost:8081/auth
* PostgreSQL DB: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openremote

### Volume Maps
* ../keycloak/theme - Maps custom keycloak theme into the Keycloak service; changes to the local theme are instantly available to the keycloak service

## Full Stack Development with HTTPS Proxy (dev-proxy.yml)
This is the same as the Full Stack Development profile but also adds the proxy service to allow development/testing of the Manager running behind the reverse proxy with HTTPS (so development environment matches final deployment configuration).


### Exposed Services
* Manager: https://localhost
* Keycloak: http://localhost:8081/auth
* PostgreSQL DB: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/openremote

### Volume Maps
* ../keycloak/theme - Maps custom keycloak theme into the Keycloak service; changes to the local theme are instantly available to the keycloak service
