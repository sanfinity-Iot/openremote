The OpenRemote Manager is responsive and can be used on mobile devices. To make use of the services of mobile devices (e.g. location service and push notifications), there are Android and iOS consoles. 

# OpenRemote iOS and Android Apps

OpenRemote includes consoles for iOS and Android. The current apps we are hosting on the Appstore and Google Play Store, direct to OpenRemote Managers we are hosting on the OpenRemote domain, for example demo.openremote.io. When you open the app the first time the app asks for the 'Project' and 'Realm' names. To access the Demo environment, the 'Project' is 'demo' and 'Realm' is 'smartcity'. It will direct the app to https://demo.openremote.io/manager/?realm=smartcity.

The first time it will ask for permission to use your location and send notifications. If enabled, you can use Rules in the Manager to define a Left-Hand-Side condition, based on a console location, or a Right-Hand-Side action to send a notification to this Console Asset (anonymous) or the Mobile User of this mobile device.

Once you come to the login page, you are accessing the Manager UI and seeing the mobile version.

Switching between projects and realms can be done by long-pressing the app icon on your home screen. Note that the default app in the Appstore and Google Play Store, direct to OpenRemote Managers we are hosting on the OpenRemote domain, for example demo.openremote.io.

# Building your own mobile apps

You can redirect the consoles to your own URL and build the apps yourself. Check out the links below and the code itself.
