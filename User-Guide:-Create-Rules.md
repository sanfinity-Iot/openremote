OpenRemote has its own rules engine which can be used for a wide range of functions, from simple linking of attributes, to complex rules based algorithms for eg. predictive models. There are 3 different types of rules scripting languages, all with their own purpose. We'll describe them here and refer to a dedicated Wiki for each type.

Rules can be built within global rulesets, allowing them to use any attribute across the different realms. Alternatively, if you select a specific realm or asset, the ruleset will only be able to use rules with attributes within the asset, or any of it child assets.

Rules include a scheduler option which allows for rules to be planned and occurrences to be repeated. Rules can also be enabled or disabled.

# WHEN-THEN rules

The WHEN-THEN rules object model is intended for application users, to create event based workflow rules, using a front-end UI. It allows you to select any attribute for the left hand side condition and right hand side action. You can additionally send notifications, use timers and use webhooks for actions. For more details and an example see [User Guide: Use When Then Rules](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Use-When-Then-Rules).

# Flow rules

The Flow rules model is intended for application users which want to link attributes together, using a conversion. Its main purpose is to allow linking of attributes (eg. a KNX switch with a Velbus light) or processing of attributes to create new 'virtual' attributes (eg. The energy consumption is the sum of three individual sub-meters). For more details and an example see [User Guide: Use Flow Rules](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Use-Flow-Rules).

# Groovy rules

Groovy rules scripting language is available within the (Technical) manager and can be used for complex rules. They have the most flexibility but also need clear understanding of the Groovy language especially to prevent errors. For more details and an example see [User Guide: Create Rules with Groovy](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/User-Guide%3A-Create-Rules-with-Groovy-Editor).
