We have a series of UI components available to swiftly create your own front end applications. We use a combination of Polymer LIT, Material Design and our own OpenRemote elements. The UI components are [published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~openremote).

_See the [Developer Guide for the current status](./Developer-Guide:-Working-on-the-UI)_

In the main branch and online demo, we have a [[Demo Smart Building|Demo-Smart-Building]]. There is a front-end example which illustrates how the Basic UI components can work.

We have a series of basic UI components, and more advanced project specific components. The current available components can be found in [openremote / ui / components](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/tree/master/ui/component):
- or-bottom-navigation
- or-header
- or-icon
- or-input
- or-map
- or-rules-editor
- or-select
- or-smart-notify
- or-thermostat
- or-timeline
- or-translate
