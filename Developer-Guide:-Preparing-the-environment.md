To build OpenRemote projects, you have to first prepare the environment on your developer workstation or build machine.

Ensure you have installed and configured the following tools:

# Runtime tooling
To run docker images from Docker Hub you need to install the following tooling:
* Docker see [here](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/wiki/Developer-Guide:-Installing-and-using-Docker#local-engine)

If you want to manage remote docker engines then you will also need to install `docker-machine` separately (since docker 2.2.x):

* [Docker machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/)

Ensure the following commands execute successfully:

```
docker ps
docker-compose version
```

If you installed docker machine  then make sure the following command executes successfully:

`docker-machine version`

# Development tooling
For development you need the following in addition to the runtime tooling:

* Java 8 JDK ([OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/), [Oracle Java SE JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), on MacOS use [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk))
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (>= 10.13.0, on MacOS you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and `brew install node@10`)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) `npm install --global yarn` (>=1.12.1)

Ensure the following commands execute successfully:

```
java -version
git --version
node -v
yarn -v
```

Ensure that you have the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set to the path of JDK.

## Docker image with tooling

Alternatively to tooling above there is a docker image with all tools required to build the stack. You don't have to
install anything other than docker and be sure that tooling version is the same as our CI/CD pipeline. This can be very
useful when you need to use other machine, e.g. deployment host.

Check current version:
```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/or registry.gitlab.com/openremote/openremote:master git status
```

Build the stack:
```
docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/or registry.gitlab.com/openremote/openremote:master ./gradlew clean installDist
```
